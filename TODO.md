# Fix Dashboard Double Scroll Issue

## Problem
The dashboard currently shows two scrollbars:
- One global scroll for the entire page
- One below the navbar
The goal is to have only one scroll below the navbar, similar to the expenses page.

## Plan
- [x] Analyze current dashboard and expenses page structure
- [ ] Modify DashboardPage.css to fix layout and scrolling
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure single scroll behavior
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior

## Progress
- [x] Understanding the problem - Dashboard uses min-height: 100vh causing global scroll
- [x] Plan approved by user
- [ ] Implement CSS fixes
- [ ] Verify the solution works correctly
